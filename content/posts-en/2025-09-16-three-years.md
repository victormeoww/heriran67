Three years ago today, Mahsa Amini died.

I was fifteen. I remember the videos. The crowds. The fire. The chanting: zan, zendegi, azadi. I remember believing, for a few weeks, that everything would change.

It didn't change.

Over 500 protesters were killed. More than 22,000 were detained. At least 10 were executed. The morality police returned. The hijab law passed. The executions surged to 900 in a year.

The UN found crimes against humanity. The world imposed sanctions. President after president made promises.

And here we are. Three years later. The same laws. The same surveillance. The same girls being stopped on the street for their hair.

But.

I have learned to pay attention to the "but."

But Narges Mohammadi won the Nobel Prize. But Toomaj Salehi was released. But the journalists were pardoned. But 84% of Iranians disagree with compulsory hijab—eighty-four percent, according to the regime's own Ministry of Culture.

But every woman who walks with her hair uncovered is a protest.

But every mother who tells her daughter the truth is a revolution.

But every girl who writes down what she sees is making a record that cannot be erased.

I don't know if I will see change in my lifetime. My grandmother didn't. My mother hasn't. But the seeds are planted. The cracks are forming. The pressure is building.

Mahsa Amini's name is known around the world now. That cannot be undone. Nika Shahkarami, Armita Geravand, Ahoo Daryaei—their names are known. That cannot be undone.

They killed them to make us afraid. Instead, they made us remember.

Three years. It feels longer. It feels like we've been fighting forever.

Maybe we have.
