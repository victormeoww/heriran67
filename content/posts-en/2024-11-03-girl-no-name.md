Yesterday, a video spread across every phone in Iran.

A young woman at Azad University in Tehran—the Science and Research campus—stripped down to her underwear in the middle of the street. Basij forces had torn her clothes while enforcing hijab rules. So she took off what was left. She walked outside, nearly naked, in an act of defiance so raw and desperate that I don't have words for it.

They took her away. The state says she is in a psychiatric hospital. They say she has mental health issues. They released a video of a man claiming to be her husband, saying the same thing.

This is what they always do. When they cannot call us criminals, they call us crazy. When they cannot imprison our bodies, they try to imprison our minds.

Narges Mohammadi—writing from inside Evin Prison, where she has been locked away for years—released a statement about the girl:

"The Science and Research Girl has no name; her name is being a woman in Iran."

I read that sentence and I started crying. I couldn't stop.

Because she's right. This girl—whoever she is—is all of us. Every woman who has been grabbed on the street. Every girl who has been humiliated for her hair. Every person who has felt their clothes torn, their dignity shredded, their humanity denied.

She stood there in her underwear in front of cameras and security forces and the whole machinery of the Islamic Republic, and she refused to disappear.

They want us to think she is crazy. But she is the sanest person I have ever seen. She did what we all want to do. She showed them exactly what their laws do to us—she made it visible, undeniable, impossible to ignore.

I don't know her name. I don't know if she's safe. I don't know if I will ever find out.

But I know that I will never forget her.
