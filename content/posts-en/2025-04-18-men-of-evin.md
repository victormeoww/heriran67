The European Union has sanctioned the director of Evin Prison.

I don't know his name. I don't want to learn his name. What I know is what he has overseen: the detention of journalists, activists, dual nationals, protesters. The torture. The solitary confinement. The denial of medical care. The political prisoners who go in healthy and come out broken—or don't come out at all.

Evin is where Narges Mohammadi has spent years of her life. Where the journalists who told us about Mahsa Amini were held. Where, in October 2022, a fire broke out during the protests—a fire accompanied by gunfire and explosions, a fire that killed at least 8 inmates.

Witnesses said there was a gun battle. Witnesses said riot police had been provoking prisoners for days, banging batons on cell doors. Some believed the fire was a government scheme to fake a jailbreak and kill prisoners under cover of chaos.

In November 2024, the judiciary upheld harsh sentences for 40 prisoners accused of involvement in the fire. No security forces were held accountable.

This is what Evin is: a place where the state can do anything to anyone and call it justice.

And now, finally, the EU has sanctioned the man in charge.

Sanctions are symbols. They freeze assets, restrict travel. They do not free prisoners. They do not bring back the dead. But they say something. They say: we see you. We know what you have done. There will be a record.

I don't know if records matter in a country where history is rewritten every day. But I keep my own records. I write down names, dates, numbers. I write down everything I can.

Someday, someone will need to know what happened here. Someone will need evidence.

I am making evidence.
