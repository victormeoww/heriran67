Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi have been pardoned.

These are the journalists who told us about Mahsa Amini. Hamedi published the photograph of Mahsa's parents embracing in the hospital. Mohammadi covered her funeral. For this, they were arrested in September 2022 and sentenced to 13 and 12 years in prison respectively.

The charges: collaborating with the US government, collusion against national security.

The truth: they did their jobs. They told us a girl was dying. They told us her name.

Now, on the anniversary of the 1979 revolution, the Supreme Leader has pardoned them.

I should feel relieved. I should feel grateful. Part of me does. They are free. After 17 months in detention, after receiving UNESCO's World Press Freedom Prize from inside prison, after becoming symbols of everything the regime fears about journalism—they are free.

But I cannot stop thinking about the word "pardoned."

Pardoned means they were guilty. Pardoned means the state had the right to imprison them. Pardoned means the system worked exactly as intended, and now the system is being merciful.

This is not justice. Justice would be an acknowledgment that they did nothing wrong. Justice would be charges against the morality police officers who killed Mahsa Amini. Justice would be a country where journalists don't go to prison for reporting the truth.

Hamedi and Mohammadi are free. I am glad they are free.

But Iran still ranks 176 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index. But journalists are still in prison. But the truth is still a crime.
