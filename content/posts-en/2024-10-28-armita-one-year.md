One year ago today, Armita Geravand died.

She was sixteen. She was on the Tehran Metro. She was not wearing hijab.

The regime says she fainted from low blood pressure. They released CCTV footage to prove it. But Amnesty International analyzed the footage and found that 3 minutes and 16 seconds were missing. Three minutes and sixteen seconds in which something happened—something the state does not want us to see.

Eyewitnesses from the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights said she was assaulted by hijab enforcers. They said she fell and hit her head. They said she was carried out unconscious by her friends.

She never woke up.

Her case was identical to Mahsa Amini's—a girl, a headscarf, the morality police, a coma, death. The only difference was that Armita's death came exactly one year after Mahsa's, when the world had already moved on, when the protests had been crushed, when the regime had proven it could kill with impunity.

The UN Fact-Finding Mission is still investigating.

Her family appeared on state television and echoed the government's narrative. I don't blame them. I know what happens to families who speak the truth. I know about Nika Shahkarami's aunt and uncle, arrested and forced to lie on camera. I know about the families of Zahedan victims, pressured to accept blood money and stay silent.

Silence is what they want. Silence is what they pay for with threats and arrests and disappearances.

But I refuse to be silent. Not today. Not on the anniversary of Armita's death.

Her name was Armita Geravand. She was sixteen years old. She died because she didn't cover her hair on the metro.

Remember her.
