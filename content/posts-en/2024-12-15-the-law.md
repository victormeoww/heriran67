They passed the law.

It is called the "Law on Protecting the Family through the Promotion of the Culture of Chastity and Hijab." The name is long enough to bury its meaning. So let me be clear about what it means:

If you are a woman in Iran and you do not cover your hair, you can now be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison.

If you "promote unveiling" in collaboration with foreign entities, you can be sentenced to death.

If you are caught without hijab multiple times, you can be fined, banned from traveling, prohibited from government employment, have your driver's license revoked.

If you are a girl as young as twelve years old, these laws apply to you.

Citizens are now required to report violations. Vigilantes who enforce compulsory veiling are legally protected.

Twelve years old.

I was twelve once. I was in school. I was learning to read poetry. I was learning to ride a bicycle. I was learning what it meant to be a girl in this country.

Now girls younger than I was then can be sent to prison for their hair.

President Pezeshkian has criticized the law. He said his administration "cannot implement such a controversial measure." The implementation has been temporarily suspended.

Temporarily.

That word does not comfort me. Nothing is temporary here except our safety. Everything else—the violence, the surveillance, the control—is permanent.
