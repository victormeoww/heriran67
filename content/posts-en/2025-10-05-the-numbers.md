I keep a document on my phone. It's encrypted. It's hidden. If anyone ever found it, I would say I don't know what it is.

It's a list of numbers. I update it when I can, when new reports come out, when the organizations I trust release new data. I'm going to share some of it now.

Executions:

2023: at least 834

2024: at least 901

Iran accounts for 74% of all executions worldwide

Woman, Life, Freedom protests (2022-2023):

Over 500 protesters killed

More than 22,000 detained

At least 10 executed

Zahedan Massacre (September 30, 2022):

104 killed in a single day (UN Fact-Finding Mission)

Snipers on rooftops. Live ammunition. Worshippers at prayer.

Hijab Law penalties:

Up to 15 years in prison for repeat violations

Possible death penalty for "promoting unveiling"

Applies to girls as young as 12

Public opinion:

84% of Iranians disagree with compulsory hijab (Ministry of Culture internal survey, 2024)

I write these numbers because they matter. Because each one represents a person, a family, a life destroyed or ended. Because the regime wants us to forget, and I refuse.

I write these numbers because someday there will be a reckoning. Someday there will be trials, archives, museums. Someday people will need to know what happened here.

And when that day comes, I want the numbers to be ready.
