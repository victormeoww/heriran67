I have been trying to understand the numbers.

In the month following the June 2024 elections—the elections that were supposed to bring reform, supposed to bring hope—at least 87 people were executed in Iran.

In 2023, the state executed at least 834 people. This was a 43% increase from 2022.

In 2024, the number has already surpassed 900.

Iran is responsible for 74% of all recorded executions worldwide.

I am seventeen years old and I am learning mathematics. Not the kind they teach in school—not algebra or geometry or calculus. I am learning the mathematics of state murder. I am learning to count bodies.

Here is what the numbers tell me: the Islamic Republic does not execute people despite its promises of reform. It executes people because of them. Every time the world believes things might change, the regime tightens its grip. Every time a "moderate" president is elected, the judiciary reminds us who actually holds power.

The Baluch, who make up 5% of Iran's population, account for 20% of executions.

At least 22 women were executed in 2023—the highest number since 2013.

At least 5 people who were children when they allegedly committed their crimes have been executed.

These are not accidents. These are not anomalies. This is policy. This is what the state looks like when it is afraid.

Because that is the truth buried beneath all these numbers: they are afraid of us. They are afraid of girls who burn their headscarves. They are afraid of rappers who write songs. They are afraid of wrestlers who speak. They are afraid of women who walk bareheaded through the streets.

So they kill us. Methodically. Legally. With judges and courts and paperwork and all the bureaucratic machinery of murder.

And they think the numbers will make us afraid.

But I have been learning mathematics. And I have learned this: there are more of us than there are of them. There have always been more of us.

They can count bodies. We count each other.
