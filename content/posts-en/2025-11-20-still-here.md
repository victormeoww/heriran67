I don't know how to end this.

I've been writing for over a year now. Recording what I see, what I hear, what I live. Trying to make sense of a country that doesn't make sense. Trying to explain something that might be unexplainable to people who have never lived it.

Sometimes I wonder if anyone reads this. Sometimes I wonder if it matters.

But then I remember: I'm not writing for readers. I'm writing for the record. I'm writing because if I don't, these things might be forgotten. I'm writing because silence is what the regime wants, and I refuse to give them what they want.

I turned eighteen this year. I am an adult in a country where adulthood means new ways to be punished. I can vote for candidates approved by men who will never let anything change. I can be imprisoned for my hair under laws meant to protect "family values."

But I am also still here.

Still by the sea. Still watching the light change over the water. Still cooking with my grandmother, still reading banned books, still breathing.

The regime thought they could crush us in 2022. They killed hundreds. They imprisoned thousands. They executed people for blocking roads, for writing songs, for speaking.

And we are still here.

Narges Mohammadi is still fighting from inside her prison cell. Women are still walking bareheaded through the streets. Girls are still whispering zan, zendegi, azadi to each other in schoolyards.

I don't know what comes next. I don't know if I'll see change in my lifetime. But I know this: we have already won something. We have made them afraid. We have made them build surveillance apps and pass draconian laws and execute 900 people in a year—because they know they are losing.

You don't build walls that high unless you're terrified of what's on the other side.

I am what's on the other side. We all are. Every woman, every girl, every person who refuses to disappear.

This is HER iran. This is my voice.

I will keep writing until I can't. And then someone else will write.

That's how we win. Not all at once. Not in a single revolution. But word by word, year by year, generation by generation.

We outlast them.

We always do.
