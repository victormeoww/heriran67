It is International Women's Day. I am supposed to write something meaningful.

Outside my window, the sea is the color of steel. Spring is coming slowly here—the air still cold, the trees still bare. But there are small signs. Buds on the branches. Birds returning. The days getting longer.

In Tehran, women are still being stopped on the street. The hijab law is suspended but not abolished. The morality police are supposed to "not confront" women, according to Pezeshkian, but they do. They always do.

I am seventeen. Not yet an adult by the laws of this country, but it makes no difference. I can vote for presidents who cannot change anything. I can be tried as an adult for the crime of my own hair.

When I was a child, my grandmother used to tell me stories about before the revolution. About wearing miniskirts to university. About dancing at parties. About a country I cannot imagine, because I have never lived in it.

I don't want to go back to the Shah. I don't want anyone to think that's what I'm saying. I want something new. Something that has never existed. A country where women are human beings. A country where girls don't die for their hair.

I don't know if I will see it. My grandmother didn't. My mother hasn't. Maybe my daughter will. Maybe her daughter.

But today, on this day that is supposed to celebrate women, I want to say this: we are still here. Despite everything, we are still here. We are still writing. Still watching. Still remembering.

Zan, zendegi, azadi.

We haven't forgotten.
