There is a kind of silence here in summer. The tourists come—Tehranis escaping the heat, families with children, young couples walking by the shore. The hotels fill up. The restaurants are crowded. Everything looks almost normal.

Almost.

The morality police are here too, of course. Watching. Waiting. The hijab law may be "suspended," but the women I see still mostly cover their hair. Old habits. Old fears. The memory of what happened to Mahsa, to Armita, to Ahoo—these memories live in our bodies now. They make us flinch when we see a woman in chador approaching. They make us check our scarves without thinking.

I went to the beach yesterday. I wore a hijab. I wore a long manteau. I watched children play in the water in their clothes—girls in full covering even to swim.

There was a woman nearby, maybe thirty, watching her daughter. She looked exhausted. Not from the heat—something else. The kind of exhaustion that comes from always being watched.

Our eyes met. She didn't say anything. I didn't say anything. But there was something there—recognition, maybe. Understanding.

This is how we communicate now. In glances. In silences. In the things we don't say out loud.

I wonder what she would say if she could. I wonder what any of us would say, if we weren't afraid.

I came home and sat by my window and watched the sea turn dark. The tourists will leave soon. Autumn will come. The regime will still be here, watching, waiting, controlling.

But so will we. Still here. Still watching back.
