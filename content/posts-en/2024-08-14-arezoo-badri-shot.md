Her name was Arezoo Badri.

I need to write that first. Her name. Because they will try to make her into a statistic, a number, a line in a report that foreigners will read and shake their heads at and then forget. But she had a name. Arezoo. It means "wish" in Farsi. It means "hope."

They shot her. Reports say she was not wearing hijab. Reports say this is why.

I don't know all the details yet. Information is slow here, unreliable, filtered through a thousand hands before it reaches us. But I know enough. I know that a woman is dead because of cloth. Because of hair. Because men in this country have decided that the ugliest thing a woman can do is exist visibly.

It has been almost two years since Mahsa Amini. Almost two years since we filled the streets and screamed until our throats bled and believed, truly believed, that something would change.

Pezeshkian has been president for one month.

Eighty-seven people were executed in the month after he was elected.

Eighty-seven.

I keep thinking about that number. I keep thinking about Arezoo Badri and her name and what she wished for. I keep thinking about all the promises and all the speeches and all the men on television saying this time, this time, things will be different.

The sea outside my window is grey today. There was a storm last night. The air smells like salt and rain and something else I can't name.

Maybe it's grief. Maybe that's what grief smells like. We've had so much of it here that it's seeped into the air itself.
