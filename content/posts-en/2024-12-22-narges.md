Narges Mohammadi has been given a 21-day medical release from Evin Prison.

Doctors discovered a suspected cancerous bone lesion. She needs surgery. After years of imprisonment, after 154 lashes sentenced, after 31 total years of prison terms, after winning the Nobel Peace Prize from inside her cell—her body is breaking down.

And still, even now, she only gets 21 days.

I don't know how to write about Narges Mohammadi without running out of words. She has been arrested 13 times. Convicted 5 times. She has spent more of her adult life in prison than out of it. Her children accepted her Nobel Prize in Oslo because she could not be there. Her husband lives in exile. She has missed birthdays, graduations, ordinary Tuesday mornings.

And she keeps fighting.

From inside Evin, she documented torture and sexual violence. She campaigned against the death penalty. She wrote her Nobel lecture and smuggled it out. She wrote about Ahoo Daryaei. She refuses, absolutely refuses, to be silent.

She said: "I will never stop striving for the realization of democracy, freedom and equality."

I read that sentence and I think about what it costs to mean it. I think about the years of her life spent in cells. I think about the lashes. I think about the bone lesion that might be cancer.

And I think about how she keeps going anyway.

Twenty-one days. That's what they've given her. Twenty-one days to have surgery and recover and see the sky and breathe air that doesn't smell like prison.

Then they'll take her back.
