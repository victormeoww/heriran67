Two years ago today, Mahsa Amini died.

I was fifteen. I remember where I was when I heard—in my room, on my phone, reading a post that someone had shared. I remember not understanding at first. A girl arrested for her hijab. A girl in a coma. A girl dead.

I remember thinking: this happens. This is Iran. Girls get arrested. Girls get hurt. Girls disappear.

But then something else happened. Something I had never seen before.

People went outside.

I watched videos on my phone of women cutting their hair in the streets. I watched videos of girls my age burning their headscarves. I watched videos of crowds chanting zan, zendegi, azadi—woman, life, freedom—and I felt something break open inside my chest.

For weeks, I couldn't sleep. I would lie in bed and scroll through footage of protests and beatings and tear gas and blood. I would read names: Nika Shahkarami, sixteen, dead. Sarina Esmailzadeh, sixteen, dead. Hadis Najafi, twenty-two, dead.

Girls. So many girls.

I wanted to go outside too. I wanted to scream. My mother wouldn't let me. She held my wrists and cried and said she couldn't lose me, she couldn't, please, please.

So I stayed inside. I stayed inside and I watched and I felt like a coward.

Two years later, I don't feel like a coward anymore. I feel like someone who survived. And survival, I've learned, is its own form of resistance.

Mahsa Amini would have been twenty-four years old today. Nika Shahkarami would have been eighteen. Armita Geravand would have been seventeen.

They didn't survive. So I have to. I have to survive and I have to remember and I have to write it down so that someone, somewhere, knows what happened here.

Jin, jiyan, azadî.

Two years. It feels like ten. It feels like yesterday.
