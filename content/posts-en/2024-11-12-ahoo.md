Her name is Ahoo Daryaei.

It took days for the name to reach us. Days of searching, of rumors, of the regime trying to bury her in silence and psychiatric diagnoses. But her name is Ahoo, and now I can write it.

Ahoo means "deer" in Farsi. Daryaei means "of the sea."

A deer of the sea. A creature that does not exist, that cannot exist, that defies the laws of nature. Maybe that's what she is. Maybe that's what all of us are—impossible creatures, girls who should not exist in the world the regime has built, but who exist anyway.

Amnesty International has called for her immediate and unconditional release. The UN Special Rapporteur is monitoring her case. The world is watching.

But she is still gone. Still locked away somewhere. Still being called insane by men who drove her to madness.

I have been thinking about what it takes to do what she did. The desperation. The fury. The moment when you realize that nothing you do will ever be enough, that they will keep taking and taking until there is nothing left, and so you give them nothing. You strip yourself bare. You say: this is what you've done to me. Look at it. Look.

I don't know if I could do that. I don't know if I'm that brave.

But I know this: every woman in Iran understood that video. Every woman in Iran has felt the hands on her clothes, the fingers gripping her scarf, the voices telling her she is wrong, she is sinful, she is less than human.

Ahoo Daryaei did not go crazy. She told the truth. And the truth is always called madness by those who cannot bear to hear it.
