A man won an election today.

They are calling him a reformist. My mother watched the results on television and said nothing. My grandmother made tea. My father scrolled through his phone, reading what people outside Iran were saying about what it means for us inside Iran.

I don't know what it means.

Masoud Pezeshkian says he believes in social freedoms. He says he wants to follow up on what happened to the morality police. He says things will be different.

I have heard men say things will be different my entire life.

Two summers ago, a girl my age was killed for her hair. Last autumn, another girl my age fell into a coma on the metro and never woke up. This spring, I watched my friend get pulled aside on the street by a woman in chador who told her she was dressed like a whore. My friend was wearing a loose manteau and a headscarf that had slipped back two centimeters.

Two centimeters.

So a man won an election today. The man says things will be different.

I am sitting by my window and looking at the sea. The Caspian doesn't care about elections. It doesn't care about reformists or hardliners or the promises men make on television. It just keeps moving, the way it has for thousands of years, the way it will keep moving long after all of us are gone.

Maybe that's the only honest thing left in this country. The sea. The mountains. The things that existed before the revolution and will exist after whatever comes next.

I want to believe him. I want to believe that something can change. But I have been a girl in Iran for sixteen years, and I have learned that hope is a kind of currency here—and we spend it faster than we earn it.

I'll wait. I'll watch.

I've gotten good at waiting.
