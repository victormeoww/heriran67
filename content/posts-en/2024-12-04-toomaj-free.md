I don't know how to write this without crying, so I will write it while crying.

Toomaj Salehi is free.

After 753 days in prison. After being sentenced to death. After 252 days in solitary confinement. After torture so severe he smuggled out a video describing it and was re-arrested for that crime—the crime of telling the truth about what they did to him.

He is free.

I remember listening to his songs during the protests. "Rat Hole." "Turkmenchay." The lyrics that said everything we felt, everything we couldn't say out loud, everything the regime wanted to silence. I remember thinking: this is what courage sounds like.

Then they took him. And I thought they would kill him. I thought I would wake up one morning to news of his execution, the way I woke up to news of Mohsen Shekari's execution, the way I woke up to news of Mohammad Mehdi Karami and Mohammad Hosseini and all the others whose names I carry inside me like stones.

But he's alive. He's out. The Supreme Court overturned his death sentence in June, and now, finally, he has walked out of prison.

I know this doesn't fix anything. I know the regime is still executing people—901 this year, more than ever. I know Narges Mohammadi is still in Evin. I know girls are still being arrested on the metro. I know the law they just passed could send twelve-year-olds to prison.

But tonight, just for tonight, I am letting myself feel something other than grief.

Toomaj is free.

Some of us survive. Some of us get out.

Maybe that's enough to keep going.
