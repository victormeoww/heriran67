The app is called Nazer.

It means "watcher" in Farsi. You can download it to your phone. You can use it to report women who are not wearing hijab. You can enter their location, the time, their license plate if they're in a car.

Citizens are encouraged to report each other. Vigilantes are protected by law.

This is what the regime has built: a country where everyone is a spy. Where your neighbor might be watching you. Where the woman behind you in line at the grocery store might photograph your uncovered hair. Where trust is impossible because betrayal is incentivized.

I think about the UN report that documented how Iran uses AI and mobile apps to monitor hijab compliance. I think about the traffic cameras deployed to detect and fine women without headscarves. I think about the text messages women receive, threatening prosecution.

And I think: they are afraid.

They are so afraid of us that they need surveillance cameras and facial recognition and an app where citizens spy on citizens. They are so afraid of a woman's hair that they have built an entire infrastructure of control to hide it.

This is not strength. This is terror.

A state that was confident in its legitimacy would not need to monitor every street corner. A government that believed in its values would not need to bribe citizens to inform on each other. A regime that had the support of its people would not be installing cameras to catch uncovered heads.

They are afraid. And they should be.

Because every woman who walks outside with her hair showing is a reminder: their control is not complete. Their power is not absolute. We are still here, still visible, still defiant.

Let them watch. Let them build their apps and their cameras and their networks of informants.

We will outlast them. We always do.
