The pomegranate trees are blooming.

I know this seems like a strange thing to write about. I have written about executions and prisons and girls dying on the metro. But today I want to write about pomegranate blossoms. About the way the air smells in late spring here, near the water. About the color of the sky at sunset, when the light turns everything gold.

Because this is also Iran. This is also my life.

The regime wants us to believe that we are nothing but our suffering. That our only story is oppression. But I refuse. I refuse to let them take the pomegranate blossoms from me. I refuse to let them take the sea.

My grandmother is teaching me to make fesenjan—the stew with pomegranates and walnuts. She learned from her mother, who learned from hers. The recipe is older than the revolution, older than the Shah, older than anyone remembers. It tastes like history. Like continuity. Like something that cannot be taken.

This is what resistance looks like, sometimes. Not protests in the streets—though that too. But also: cooking with your grandmother. Speaking Kurdish or Baluchi or Azeri at home when they want you to speak only Farsi. Listening to music they've banned. Reading books they've burned. Falling in love. Having joy.

They want us dead or silent or broken.

Being alive and speaking and whole—that is defiance too.

The pomegranate trees are blooming. The sea is blue today. I am seventeen years old and I am still here.
