The Iranian judiciary has reduced charges against security officers involved in the Zahedan massacre.

I need you to understand what this means.

On September 30, 2022—a day now called "Bloody Friday"—security forces opened fire on protesters and worshippers near the Grand Mosalla mosque in Zahedan. The protests were part of the Woman, Life, Freedom movement, but they were also sparked by something local: the alleged rape of a 15-year-old Baluch girl by a police commander.

The UN Fact-Finding Mission documented 104 people killed on that single day. Amnesty International confirmed at least 82. Many were men and boys. Some were children. Snipers were positioned on rooftops around the mosque, shooting at heads and chests. People were finishing Friday prayers.

104 people. One day. One city.

And now, more than two years later, the judiciary has decided to shield senior officials from accountability. Only low-ranking officers face any consequences at all. Light sentences. Reduced charges.

This is what justice looks like in the Islamic Republic. This is what happens when the state kills a hundred people in a single afternoon: nothing. Less than nothing. Protection for the killers.

The Baluch are 5% of Iran's population and 20% of its executions. They are marginalized, impoverished, forgotten. When they die, the world barely notices. When their children are raped and their worshippers are massacred, the judiciary protects the perpetrators.

I am not Baluch. I live far from Zahedan, by a different sea. But I carry Bloody Friday inside me the way I carry Mahsa and Nika and Armita. The way I carry every name.

Because when the state can kill with impunity, none of us are safe. Not the Baluch. Not the Kurds. Not the women. Not anyone.
