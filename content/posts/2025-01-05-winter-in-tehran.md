From my apartment window, I can see the Alborz Mountains covered in fresh snow. On clear mornings, they glow pink in the sunrise. It's breathtaking — the kind of beauty that makes you forget, just for a moment, everything else.

But this winter feels different.

## The Cold That Settles In

Tehran winters have always been harsh, but this year the cold feels more penetrating. Maybe it's because gas prices have tripled and heating our apartment is becoming impossible. Maybe it's because the power cuts last longer now, leaving us bundled in blankets at midday.

Or maybe it's because the cold isn't just physical anymore. There's a chill that's settled over the city — a kind of exhaustion, a communal weariness that seeps into everything.

## Contrasts

What strikes me most about living here is the constant contradiction:

The mountains are stunning. The air is poisonous.

The architecture is magnificent. The infrastructure is crumbling.

The people are warm and generous. The government is cold and punishing.

You learn to hold these contradictions in your mind simultaneously. You learn to love your country while hating what's been done to it. You learn to see beauty through the brutality.

## What Keeps Us Warm

Last week, during a particularly bad power outage, my neighbors gathered in the stairwell. Someone brought tea. Someone else brought bread and cheese. We sat there for hours, sharing stories, laughing at absurdities, complaining about everything.

It wasn't a protest. It wasn't even political. It was just people refusing to freeze alone.

And that, I think, is how we survive winters like this — not by escaping the cold, but by finding warmth in each other.

The Alborz Mountains are still beautiful.

The city is still standing.

And we are still here, huddled together, waiting for spring.
