**Update as of 9:00 PM Tehran time:**

Mobile internet has been completely shut down in central Tehran neighborhoods including Enghelab Square, Vanak, and Tajrish. Wi-Fi connections remain unstable but sporadically accessible.

This is the third major shutdown this month.

## What We Know

- **Shutdown began:** Approximately 4:30 PM local time
- **Affected areas:** Central Tehran, expanding outward
- **Duration:** Unknown (previous shutdowns lasted 3-7 days)
- **Official explanation:** None provided

## Why This Matters

Internet shutdowns are not just inconveniences — they are tools of control. When connectivity drops, it becomes nearly impossible to:

- Document human rights violations in real-time
- Coordinate peaceful protests
- Share information about arrests and crackdowns
- Contact family members for safety checks
- Access international news and independent media

In short: **they want us isolated, uninformed, and unable to organize.**

## How People Are Responding

Despite the blackout, people are finding ways to communicate:

- VPNs and proxy servers (when they work)
- Satellite internet connections (expensive, but growing)
- Word of mouth and physical meetups
- Pre-arranged signal systems

There's a grim expertise developing here — we're learning to operate in digital silence, to pass information like contraband, to organize in the gaps they can't yet control.

## What You Can Do

If you're reading this from outside Iran:

1. **Amplify these updates** — we can't always speak for ourselves
2. **Document the shutdowns** — keep a record of these violations
3. **Support tools that bypass censorship** — VPN services, Tor, satellite internet projects
4. **Don't forget us when the internet goes dark** — our silence doesn't mean compliance
