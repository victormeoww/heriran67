Resilience isn't always dramatic.

Sometimes it's my mother humming an old Persian song while cooking dinner, even though the news has been unbearable all week. Sometimes it's my younger sister still dancing in her bedroom with the door closed, even though public dancing is forbidden.

Sometimes resilience is just **continuing to exist, to take up space, to refuse to disappear.**

## The Weight of Everyday Survival

People outside Iran often ask me: "How do you do it? How do you keep going?"

The truth is, we don't have a choice. Life doesn't pause for oppression. You still have to go to work, cook meals, pay bills, care for aging parents, celebrate birthdays, fall in love, grieve losses. Survival isn't heroic — it's mandatory.

But somewhere in that survival, there's also resistance.

## Small Rebellions

Yesterday, I wore red lipstick to the grocery store. That's it. That's the whole story.

But in a country where women are told to be invisible, where our clothing is policed and our appearances are legislated, choosing to wear red lipstick becomes a statement. Not a big one. Not a dangerous one. But a statement nonetheless.

These are the small rebellions that make up our days:

- A teenage girl letting a strand of hair slip from her hijab
- A couple holding hands on a park bench
- Someone whistling a protest song under their breath
- A grandmother teaching her granddaughter banned poetry

None of these acts will topple the regime. But together, they form a kind of living archive of refusal.

## Why It Matters

I think about this a lot: **if we disappear into compliance, into silence, into self-erasure — then they win without even trying.**

So we stay visible. We stay loud, even when our voices shake. We stay human, even when they try to reduce us to ideology, to symbols, to threats.

My mother sings in the kitchen.

My sister dances in her room.

And I write these words, knowing someone, somewhere, will read them and feel less alone.

That's resilience.

That's resistance.

**That's everything.**
