The walls in my neighborhood speak louder than any of us dare to.

Last Tuesday, I walked home after curfew — not because I was defiant, but because my shift at the hospital ran late again. The streets were empty, the kind of quiet that feels heavy, oppressive. But as I turned onto my street, I noticed something I'd walked past a hundred times without really seeing.

There, on the corner building, beneath three layers of beige paint, you could still make out the ghost of a slogan from the protests. Someone had tried to erase it, cover it up, make it disappear. But the paint is thinner now, and when the streetlight hits it at just the right angle, you can read the words underneath: **"Woman, Life, Freedom."**

## The Memory of Walls

They paint over the graffiti every few weeks. It's become a kind of ritual — the authorities send crews at dawn to whitewash the revolutionary messages, the names of the martyred, the cries for change. By noon, the walls look clean, neutral, like nothing ever happened there.

But the city remembers.

You can see it in the way the paint peels, revealing layers of history. You can see it in the cracks where new messages seep through. And if you know where to look — if you've been watching long enough — you can read entire conversations written across months, voices layered on top of each other, refusing to be silent.

I think about this a lot: **how much effort it takes to erase us, and how little it takes for us to reappear.**

## What They Can't Paint Over

A few months ago, my friend Leyla was arrested for forty-eight hours. They let her go with a warning — no charges, just "questioning." When I saw her afterward, she looked exhausted but not defeated.

"They asked me if I'd been writing graffiti," she said, laughing bitterly. "Like that's the thing they should be worried about. Words on a wall."

But they *are* worried. They're worried because they understand something fundamental: **every act of visibility is an act of defiance.** Every slogan, every memorial, every refusal to disappear — it all adds up. It all matters.

The walls remember what they want us to forget.

## A City That Refuses to Forget

Walking through Tehran now, you learn to read between the lines. You learn to see the faint outlines of protests past. You learn that silence isn't always compliance — sometimes it's just survival, a temporary cover, like the beige paint they spread over our words.

Underneath, we're still there.

Underneath, the city still speaks.

*To anyone reading this from outside Iran: share these words carefully. Amplify them wisely. And remember that for every voice you hear, there are a thousand more we can't risk raising — yet.*
