This is **HER iran** — an anonymous editorial platform where I, an Iranian woman living inside Iran, share my perspective on life, politics, society, and the everyday reality of living under this regime.

## Why This Blog Exists

The stories you hear about Iran are often filtered, politicized, or incomplete. I write to offer something more honest: a direct, unfiltered look at life here — the struggles, the beauty, the contradictions, and the truths that don't make international headlines.

I remain anonymous for my safety and the safety of those around me. This is not a choice; it is a necessity.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Essays** — Longer reflections on Iranian society, culture, politics, and personal experience.
- **Breaking News** — Real-time updates on events inside Iran that may not be widely reported.
- **Personal** — Intimate glimpses into daily life, observations, and moments of resistance and resilience.
